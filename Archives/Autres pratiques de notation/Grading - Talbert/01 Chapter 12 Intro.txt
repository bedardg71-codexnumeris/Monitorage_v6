Grading for growth - How to do it

CHAPTER 12
HOW TO DO IT

Between the case studies and workbook, you've made a plan to set up your own class to use alternative grading. In this chapter, we'll look at how to make alternative grading work on a day-to-day basis. Well address common on-the-ground issues and give some direct advice to help make your class succeed.
You can read the sections in this chapter in any order. We envision most readers flipping to different sections as the need arises, while they are planning an alternatively graded course or as the semester progresses.
To begin, here's some advice about what to do, and not do, in an alternatively graded course that applies to everyone:
*   Focus on student learning. As you go through the semester, you will undoubtedly encounter unexpected issues. As a rule, resolve them with student learning as the highest priority and not by setting arbitrary policies and expecting compliance. Ask yourself: What resolution to this issue will make it easier for students to demonstrate what they have learned? But at the same time ...
*   Set boundaries. In particular, limit reassessments, which are the major place where a new practitioner can become overwhelmed. See our advice in this chapter for details.
*   Work ahead. If you're expecting students to need multiple attempts to complete a standard, prewrite three or four assessments for each standard before the semester begins. Although writing a single reassessment isn’t terribly time-consuming, many instructors become overwhelmed by having to write several of them at once during the semester; you can save yourself some stress by doing this beforehand.
*   Get connected. Find a colleague to convert a class with you, or find an online community. It helps to have people to talk with, and to provide advice and support when you need it.

Finally, enjoy! You'll see benefits for both students and yourself, and you may never want to go back to traditional grading methods again.
